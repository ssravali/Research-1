EMG signals classification

Date:- 4/10/2018
Data has been collected from the ninaPro database5 and split into excel sheets. Each excel sheet has labeled data from all the 10 patients in 1 different files in accordance to their channels.
Upon testing with dictionary learning and scalrisation, though classification worked for the EMG signals in the hackathon, it didnt work with this huge amout of data. 
The output from DL and scalarisation is matrix filled with zeros. Therefore, network will be fed dirrectly to a simple cnn.
